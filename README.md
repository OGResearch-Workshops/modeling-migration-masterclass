# From `.m` to `.py`: Your Modeling Migration Masterclass

### Transform Your Macroeconomic Modeling Skills from Matlab to Python

---

## Overview

This intensive 2-day on-site program is designed for macroeconomic modelers
planning a transition from Matlab/Iris Toolbox to Python/IrisPie. This
masterclass will let you quickly peek into how to bridge your existing modeling
expertise with modern Python-based workflows, to ensure and maintain your
productivity while embracing the power and the hands-on flexibility of
open-source tools.

This 2-day masterclass is intended for the participants to actively observe the
transition process, understand the key differences between Matlab and Python,
and learn enough to make informed decisions about migrating their own modeling
and forecasting environments. More customized and systematic assistance and
training can be provided based on a further bilateral agreement.

**Ideal for:**

* Economists, analysts, and researchers who operate macroeconomic models and
  need practical guidance on migrating their skills and workflows to Python

* Managers who want to initiate and oversee this transition and to see it
  succeed smoothly.

## Our Teaching Approach

#### The "Rosetta Stone" Method

Every concept is taught through **side-by-side comparisons** between
Matlab/IrisToolbox and Python/IrisPie, making the transition intuitive and
building on your existing knowledge.


#### Emphasis on Real-World Gotchas

We focus on the **critical differences** that experienced Matlab users
encounter:

- Assignment by reference vs. by value
- Module execution vs. script concepts
- Data structure nuances
- Environment management essentials

## Program Structure

#### Block 1: Illustrative Setup of Your Python Modeling Environment

- VS Code configuration for economic modeling
- Git basics for version control
- Virtual environments and package management with PyPI
- Installing IrisPie and dependencies

#### Block 2: Essential Matlab vs Python Differences

- Syntactical and semantic differences between Matlab and Python
- The module concept: why there are no "scripts" in Python and workarounds
- Basic data types and structures
- Common transition pitfalls and how to avoid them

#### Block 3: Data Management and Time Series

- Time series objects and data structures
- Time periods and frequency handling
- Data import/export workflows (CSV, Excel, JSON, etc.)
- Data management and manipulation, simple time series modeling 
- Charting and visualization with matplotlib/plotly

#### Block 4: Model File Language Migration

- Model files: syntactical differences, differences in the underlying logic
- Equation specification and parameter handling
- Templating and modular model design
- Model objects and their properties

#### Block 5: Core Modeling Workflows

- Steady state computation: Matlab vs Python approaches
- Model solution techniques and diagnostics
- Simulation fundamentals
- Anticipated vs unanticipated shocks
- Conditioning through simulation plans and exogenization/endogenization
- Advanced simulation techniques (perfect foresight, stacked-time methods)
- First-order versus nonlinear simulations

**Key Insight**: The underlying modeling logic remains the same—only the syntax changes

#### Block 6: AI-Assisted Code Migration

- Using AI for code translation
- Best practices for prompt engineering with modeling code
- Building your personal "cheat sheet" for future migrations

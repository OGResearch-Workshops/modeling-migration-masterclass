# From `.m` to `.py`: Your Modeling Migration Masterclass

### Transform Your Macroeconomic Modeling Skills from Matlab to Python

---

## Overview

This intensive 2-3 day on-site training program is designed for macroeconomic
modelers transitioning from Matlab/Iris Toolbox to Python/IrisPie. The hands-on
masterclass bridges your existing modeling expertise with modern Python-based
workflows, ensuring you maintain productivity while embracing the power and
flexibility of open-source tools.

**Ideal for:** Economists, analysts, and researchers who operate macroeconomic
models and need practical guidance on migrating their skills and workflows to
Python.

## Our Teaching Approach

#### The "Rosetta Stone" Method

Every concept is taught through **side-by-side comparisons** between
Matlab/IrisToolbox and Python/IrisPie, making the transition intuitive and
building on your existing knowledge.


#### Emphasis on Real-World Gotchas

We focus on the **critical differences** that experienced Matlab users encounter:

- Assignment by reference vs. by value
- Module execution vs. script concepts
- Data structure nuances
- Environment management essentials


#### Structured Learning Path

- **Observe** the instructor demonstrate real workflows
- **Practice** on your own machine with guided support
- **Apply** techniques to your actual modeling challenges

## Program Structure

#### Block 1: Setting Up Your Python Modeling Environment

- VS Code configuration for economic modeling
- Git basics for version control
- Virtual environments and package management with PyPI
- Installing and configuring IrisPie

#### Block 2: Essential Matlab vs Python Differences

- Assignment semantics: when `x = y` behaves differently
- The module concept: why there are no "scripts" in Python and workarounds
- Basic data types and structures
- Common transition pitfalls and how to avoid them

#### Block 3: Data Management and Time Series

- Time series objects and data structures
- Time periods and frequency handling
- Data import/export workflows (CSV, Excel, databases)
- Databank management and manipulation
- Charting and visualization with matplotlib/plotly

#### Block 4: Model File Language Migration

- Model files: syntactical differences, differences in the underlying logic
- Equation specification and parameter handling
- Templating and modular model design
- Model objects and their properties

#### Block 5: Core Modeling Workflows

- Steady state computation: Matlab vs Python approaches
- Model solution techniques and diagnostics
- Simulation fundamentals
- Anticipated vs unanticipated shocks
- Conditioning through simulation plans and exogenization/endogenization
- Advanced simulation techniques (perfect foresight, stacked-time methods)
- First-order versus nonlinear simulations

**Key Insight**: The underlying modeling logic remains the same—only the syntax changes


#### Block 6: Active Modeling Practice

- Work through complete modeling examples on your laptop
- Port simple models from your own work
- Troubleshoot common errors with instructor guidance
- Performance optimization tips

#### Block 6: AI-Assisted Code Migration

- Using AI for code translation
- Best practices for prompt engineering with modeling code
- Building your personal "cheat sheet" for future migrations
